# Toyota Way

- Apply a long-term philosophy — Base decisions on your company's long-term philosophy, even if your short-term goals suffer as a result. Pursuing a long-term strategy is always the wisest course, but that long-range goal must be about more than just making money. *Your company's primary mission, properly conceived, is to generate value for your customers and for society at large.* As part of its long-term philosophy, Toyota avoids layoffs at all costs. It emphasizes self-reliance and taking responsibility for deciding your own fate. Honor, respect and dedication are important values. Toyota feels a long-term responsibility as a global citizen and feels accountable for the long-range stability of its business partners.
- Create continuous flow — Bring issues to the surface, where they can be addressed, by creating a continuous or "one-piece" flow. With a lean flow, one problem may shut down the entire assembly line. This appears very inefficient, but it means that problems get addressed and corrected very quickly because everyone focuses on solving them.
- Use 'pull' systems and avoid overproduction — A push system loads products onto the retailer, regardless of how quickly the retailer can sell them. A pull system provides products just as the retailer needs them. This avoids the biggest source of manufacturing waste: overproduction.
- Level the workload — The Japanese word for leveling the workload is called "heijunka." Production levels should be the same and constant. Output should not vary from day to day. Although you seek to avoid overproduction, you cannot build product efficiently just as it is ordered because the production swings would be too inefficient.
- Build the right culture — The correct culture stops everything to fix problems and strives to get quality right the first time. It refuses to compromise on quality.
- Standardize tasks — Make tasks similar and consistent wherever possible. People get better at things they do repeatedly. Standard work sheets help to avoid defects.
- Use visual control — Some plants are so jammed with inventory and parts that no one can see the actual work taking place. You should be able to see the processes underway in your plant. Maintain visual control, so that no processes are hidden. This is why a thorough clean up is a common early activity in TPS initiatives.
- Use only tested technology — Toyota rarely tries to use cutting-edge technology. Rather, it looks for well-proven technology. Adopt technology only if it supports your people, your processes or your values.
- Grow leaders who live the philosophy — Senior managers cannot let their egos stand in the way of the organization's best interest. When organizational leaders earnestly live the TPS philosophy, rather than just giving it lip service, they incorporate team members' ideas and they put customers first.
- Develop people and teams — To have excellent teams, you need excellent team members. Respect for people means respecting their minds, ideas and capabilities. Teamwork is critical.
- Respect your extended network — Often a company is only as good as its partners and suppliers. To obtain better suppliers, challenge your current suppliers to improve, and help them. Toyota expects all of its supplier partners to rise to their high standards of excellence, and will help them to do so.
- Observe the source — Go and observe a situation yourself so that you can understand it. Toyota managers commonly watch a business process take place and then ask "why" over and over until they understand it. Go see for yourself.
- Decide slowly, implement rapidly — A sound organization takes its time making decisions and decides issues by consensus, after thoroughly considering all the options. Implement ideas rapidly once consensus is achieved.
- Practice relentless reflection — Relentless reflection, or "hansei," leads to kaizen, or continuous improvement. Continuous reflection means becoming a learning organization. Be passionate about identifying the root causes of problems and developing solutions.
